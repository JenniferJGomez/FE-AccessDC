This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

App Objective:

Designed the app for people with disabilities in mind to allow users to favorite, rate, and review a location with a detailed, first-hand experience to help prepare other people with disabilities before visiting a location. The app serves the disabled population with a goal of expanding the purpose into ensuring ADA compliance in the future.

● Utilized the MVC model that allows for ​total separation in programming logic and the interface code,
and also the separation in the type of logical code for that web application.
● Parsed through the Yelp API for seed data to render onto the web page while implementing RESTful
routing with React to create visible content.
● Built full CRUD capabilities to enhance the users experience while navigating the app.
